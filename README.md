### Void Teleport has an [Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/5jTmCzjvZQ) to help you with setup.

# Info
Teleports a player automatically back to specified point, after the player falls into the void.

## Features

- Per-world spawn points
- Global spawn point
- Uses storage to store locations instead of scoreboards
- Does not round-up the co-ordinates hence teleports to precise location.
- Multiplayer support

- A nice [wiki](https://github.com/Amethyst-Development/VoidTP/wiki)!
- Supported versions: 1.20.2-1.20.5
